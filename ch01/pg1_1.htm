<h1><a name = "intro">1 Introduction</a></h1>

The particle system defined in the engine encompasses more than just flying
sprites.
<br>
The particle system is a pipeline through which models, beams and
trail effects can be defined and utilized by the game-logic without having to
know how to program a single line of code.

<p>In this document we'll go over the conventions and commands you need to look
at if you want to create particle effects.

<h2><a name = "what">1.1 What is a particle config?</a></h2>

Particle configs short text scripts that define the properties of a particle
effect as it appears and interacts in a game world.
<br>
For example, it defines which textures and shapes are used and if they emit
sound, light or collide with the geometry around them.

<p>Particle configs are located in the particles/ directory, using the '.cfg'
file extension.

<p>Contained within a particle config we can define multiple effects of similar
nature. Let's look at the particle config: 'particles/volume.cfg' which as of
this writing only contains one entry:

<p><pre class = "type">
r_part dustmote
{
	texture		ball
	type			normal
	count			1
	blend			add
	rgbf 0 0 0
	alpha 0

	rampmode lerp
	ramp 0 0 0 0 0.5
	ramp 0 0 0 0 0.5
	ramp 0 0 0 0 0.5
	ramp 255 255 190 0.5 0.5
	ramp 0 0 0 0 0.5

	die				10 5
	gravity			1
	scalefactor		0
} 
</pre>

<p>This is a more complex material, dealing with pre-programmed color and alpha
changes over time to create the effect of dust traveling inside a volume.

<h2><a name = "conventions">1.2 Particle Name &amp; File Conventions</a></h2>
The first line tells the engine that we're defining a new particle effect with
the name 'dustmote'.
<br>
As this effect is defined in the file 'volume.cfg', the
name by which this specific effect will be accessible is 'volume.dustmote'.
