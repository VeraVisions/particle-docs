<h1>2 General Keywords</h1>

<h2><a name = "type">2.1 type &lt;mode&gt;</a></h2>
<p><pre class = "type">
	How the particles look.

	Mode may be:
		beam: valid only for trails. Particles form a single textured beam acting as nodes along it.
		spark: particles are lines, their length depending upon their speed.
		sparkfan: particles are non-planar triangle fans, their length depending upon their speed.
		texturedspark: textured particles are aligned along their direction of movement, their length depending upon their speed, width equal to their scale.
		cdecal/decal: particles are spawned only upon bsp geometry. They are clipped by it.
		udecal: unclipped decal. exact semantics are subject to change.
		normal/*default*: Particles are regular, rotating, 2d images.
</pre>

<h2><a name = "count">2.2 count &lt;min&gt; &lt;max&gt;</a></h2>
<p><pre class = "type">
	Point/box effects only (not trails or beams)
	Specifies how many particles are spawned per effect (some classic effects contain an extra scaler which is multiplied by the resulting value)
</pre>

<h2><a name = "assoc">2.3 assoc &lt;effectname&gt;</a></h2>
<p><pre class = "type">
	Specifies another effect to spawn at the same time that this effect is spawned.
	Thus allowing two sets of particles from one effect.
</pre>

<h2><a name = "die">2.4 die &lt;maximum age&gt; &lt;minimum age&gt;</a></h2>
<p><pre class = "type">
	Specifies the maximum age of the particle, in seconds.
</pre>

<h2><a name = "spawnmode">2.5 spawnmode &lt;mode&gt; [arg1] [arg2]</a></h2>
<p><pre class = "type">
	This affects how particles are positioned when they first spawn, and their initial velocities.

	For point effects, mode may be one of:
		box: simple axially aligned box of particles.
		circle: particles spawn within a ball with uniform distance from the center. none will appear in the middle.
			arg1: percentage of the circle to cover. a value of 5 will go around the circle 5 separate times. this can be used for weird beam effects.
			areaspread: the radius of the ball
			areaspreadvert: the height of the ball. if 0, will be a flat circle
		ball: particles spawn randomly within a ball.
			areaspread: the radius of the ball
			areaspreadvert: the height of the ball. if 0, will be a flat circle.
		telebox: matches quake's telebox
		lavasplash: like chthon's lava splash
		uniformcircle: particles are spawned in a circle with uniform distance between and from the center. z=0.
		syncfield: particles spawn at predictable locations based upon time within a rough sphere. Only useful for effects that are regenerated+replaced every frame.
		distball:
		*default*: regular box. particles are spawned inside an axially aligned box.

	For trail effects, mode may be one of:
		spiral: particles are given velocities perpendicular to the direction based on the distance moved.
		tracer: particles spawn with alternating horizontal velocities (a wake effect).
		*default*: particles spawn as a regular trail.
</pre>

<h2><a name = "clippeddecal">2.6 clippeddecal &lt;mask&gt; [match]</a></h2>
<p><pre class = "type">
	Implies 'type decal'.
	The two extra args allow you to spawn these decals ONLY on surfaces with matching surfaceflags.
	Separation of mask+match allows you to create many descrete surface types instead of being limited to 32 bits/types.
</pre>

<h2><a name = "spawntime">2.7 spawntime &lt;value&gt;</a></h2>
<h2><a name = "spawnchance">2.8 spawnchance &lt;value&gt;</a></h2>


<h2><a name = "emit">2.9 emit &lt;effectname&gt;</a></h2>
<p><pre class = "type">
	Specifies the effect to periodically emit.
</pre>

<h2><a name = "emitinterval">2.10 emitinterval &lt;min&gt;</a></h2>
<p><pre class = "type">
	Particles will not emit additional effects for this duration after emitting one.
</pre>

<h2><a name = "emitintervalrand">2.11 emitintervalrand &lt;extra&gt;</a></h2>
<p><pre class = "type">
	FIXME: fold into emitinterval
</pre>

<h2><a name = "emitstart">2.12 emitstart &lt;seconds&gt;</a></h2>
<p><pre class = "type">
	Prevents the particle from emitting anything for this duration when it first spawns.
</pre>

<h2><a name = "perframe">2.13 perframe</a></h2>
<p><pre class = "type">
	Apply inverse frametime to count (causes emits to be per frame).
</pre>

<h2><a name = "averageout">2.14 averageout</a></h2>
<p><pre class = "type">
	Average trail points from start to end, useful with t_lightning, etc
</pre>

<h2><a name = "nostate">2.15 nostate</a></h2>
<p><pre class = "type">
	Causes the particle system to ignore all state information.
</pre>

<h2><a name = "sound">2.16 sound &lt;name&gt; [options]</a></h2>
<p><pre class = "type">
	Plays a sound when the effect is spawned.
	Only ONE sound will be used, picked randomly from the included sounds according to their weights.

	Options are:
		vol=
		attn=
		pitch=
		delay=
		weight=
</pre>

<h2><a name = "model">2.17 model &lt;name&gt; [options]</a></h2>
<p><pre class = "type">
	Spawns sprites or models that fly away with random angles and run through
	some frame sequence. handy for simple gib effects.

	Options are:
		frame=
		framestart=
		framecount=
		frameend=
		frames=
		framerate=
		skin=
		alpha=
		scalemin=
		scalemax=
		trail=
		orient
		additive
		transparent
		fullbright
		shadow
		noshadow
</pre>

<h2><a name = "viewspace">2.18 viewspace [frac]</a></h2>
<p><pre class = "type">
	Specifies that this particle type should move relative to the camera.
	Should not normally be used in combination with clipping/bouncing.
	Not compatible with most splitscreen games.
</pre>
